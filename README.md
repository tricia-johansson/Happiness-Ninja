# Happiness Ninja

A web application and website about humorous self-care and personal growth.
This project is just a prototype, meaning it is in its early stage and I don't know yet how it's going to turn out. It's still a work in progress.
My goal with this project is to build a website / web application that can light people up in a humorous way while still providing real psychology. However, it will not be something that should be compared with apps made by mental health professionals... but still, an app that can make people smile.
